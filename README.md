# Eco-Swap
Eco-Swap is an online platform that facilitates the exchange of our users’ second-hand items. This promotes reusability as it allows otherwise neglected items to find themselves in new homes instead of landfills.

It features a listings page where you can list your items, and a browse items page where you can view other peoples items.  
You can run the code on [Replit](https://replit.com/@RaymondZRWei/Eco-Swapfinal)
